This privacy policy is applicable to the _Zeroagent_ app (hereinafter referred to as "_Application_") for web browsers, which was developed by _Zeromagic Labs Private Limited_ (hereinafter referred to as "_Service Provider_") as a a Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".


This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.


If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.


The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at _Zeroagent_ unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.


## **Information Collection and Use**


For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

 
- **Audit Your App Connections**

    Connect approved apps such as Shopify and configure mindfully. Since we only store and transfer data that you configure _Zeroagent_ for, the first step is to only connect apps to _Zeroagent_ that you have a compliant relationship with.


- **Delete Your App Connections**
     
    We allow anyone to delete their account as well as any Chat History which might contain personal information. Deleting your account also deletes or anonymizes all personal data we might have collected (except for things we must keep for other compliance, like billing records in order to pay taxes, etc.). 


 
- **Survey Information**
    We collect survery information submitted through surveys or from the content of any testimonials.


At _ZeroAgent_, our primary relationship revolves around users acting as **Data Controllers** and _ZeroAgent_ as a **Data Processor**. For instance, when a Shopify store owner integrates their store with _ZeroAgent_ to capture customer information (like Store ID, First Name, Last Name, and Email Address), _ZeroAgent_ functions as the Data Processor that facilitates this data transfer. In addition to processing the data provided by the **Data Controller**, _ZeroAgent_ may also process additional data, such as files, if provided to it. This additional data enables our **AI Agents** to gain more comprehensive knowledge and provide more accurate and informative responses.


In this scenario, Shopify serve as **Data Processors**, with _ZeroAgent_ coordinating the flow of information. Additionally, _ZeroAgent_ relies on several Sub-Service Providers to support its operations. Key examples include Microsoft Azure (our hosting provider) and Microsoft Azure OpenAI Services (our LLM provider). We prioritize minimizing data access for each Sub-Service Provider; for instance, Azure manages all user data, whereas Azure OpenAI only accesses a limited amount of data for context generation purposes.
