Are you looking for ways to enhance the user experience on your website? Do you want to provide instant support and answers to your visitors' queries? Look no further! ZeroAgent's SDK enables you to repurpose AI shopping agents as knowledge base agents, perfect for static sites like landing pages, documentation, community forums, and more. By integrating AI-driven knowledge base agents, you can provide real-time assistance, answer queries, and elevate the user experience. Here's how ZeroAgent transforms static sites into interactive, customer-centric platforms:

## **Elevate Static Websites with ZeroAgent**

<br />

Static websites often serve as key points of interaction for businesses, offering information, resources, or services. However, they can lack interactivity, leaving users to navigate pages manually for answers. ZeroAgent’s SDK changes this dynamic by embedding an AI agent capable of:

- **Knowledge Base Integration**: The agent can access a pre-built knowledge base containing FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and documentation.
- **Instant Query Resolution**: Users can type questions into the agent, and it responds with precise, context-aware answers.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Instead of searching through multiple pages, users can get direct answers, saving time and effort.

<br />

## **How ZeroAgent Works on Static Sites**
<br />

**1. Seamless Integration**: Embedding ZeroAgent is simple and requires minimal coding. Whether your site is built with plain HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, the SDK provides ready-to-use tools for a quick setup. Developers can customize the agent’s appearance and behavior to align with the website’s branding.

<br />

**2. Building a Knowledge Base**: With ZeroAgent, you can upload and organize essential content, such as product information, technical support guides, and community FAQs. This knowledge base powers the AI, enabling it to provide relevant responses to user queries.

<br />

**3. AI-Powered Assistance**: Once integrated, the agent acts as a 24/7 virtual assistant. Visitors can interact with the agent to troubleshoot issues, ask about product features, or explore your offerings. For example:

- On a documentation site: <u>"How do I set up feature X?"</u>
- On a community site: <u>"What are the guidelines for participation?"</u>
- On a landing page: <u>"What are the key benefits of this product?"</u>

<br />


## **Use Cases for ZeroAgent's SDK**

- <u>Landing Pages:</u> Provide instant answers to visitor questions about your product or service, increasing conversions and reducing bounce rates.
- <u>Documentation:</u> Offer contextual help and support within your documentation, reducing support tickets and improving user understanding.
- <u>Community Forums:</u> Enhance user engagement and provide instant answers to common questions, reducing the workload on community moderators.
